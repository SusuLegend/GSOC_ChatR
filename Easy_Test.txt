Creating an R package from scratch involves several steps. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create a native
R package:

**Step 1: Create a new directory for your package**

Create a new directory for your package and navigate into it using the command line or terminal.

```bash
mkdir mypackage
cd mypackage
```

**Step 2: Initialize the package**

Use the `R CMD build` command to initialize the package. This will create a subdirectory called "build" in your
package directory.

```bash
R CMD build init_r --build-vendor .
```

This will create a `DESCRIPTION` file and an empty `R` directory.

**Step 3: Create the R source files**

Create the R source files for your package. These can be functions, data sets, or other R code.

For example, let's say you want to create a function called `my_function()`. You would add it to an R file like
this:

```r
# mypackage/R/myfunction.R

my_function <- function(x) {
  x * 2
}
```

**Step 4: Create the documentation**

Create documentation for your package using the `roxygen2` package. This will generate documentation files in the
"man" directory.

First, install the `roxygen2` package:

```bash
install.packages("roxygen2")
```

Then, run the following command to create the documentation:

```r
R CMD build roxygen2
```

**Step 5: Create the NAMESPACE file**

Create a `NAMESPACE` file that lists all the R functions and objects in your package.

For example, let's say you want to list the `my_function()` function in your package. You would add it to the
`NAMESPACE` file like this:

```r
# mypackage/R/NAMESPACE

export(
  my_function
)
```

**Step 6: Create a vignette (optional)**

Create a vignette for your package using the `vignettes` function.

For example, let's say you want to create a vignette called "Introduction" that introduces your package. You would
add it to an R file like this:

```r
# mypackage/R/introduction.R

library(mypackage)

introduction <- function() {
  cat("Welcome to mypackage!\n")
}
```

**Step 7: Build the package**

Finally, use the `R CMD build` command to build your package.

```bash
R CMD build . --build-vendor
```

This will create a tarball of your package in the "build" directory.

**Step 8: Test the package**

Test the package by loading it into R and running some example code.

For example, let's say you want to test the `my_function()` function. You would add it to an R file like this:

```r
# mypackage/R/test.R

library(mypackage)

test_my_function <- function() {
  result <- my_function(5)
  cat("Result:", result, "\n")
}

test_my_function()
```

This will load your package and run the `my_function()` function.

That's it! You've now created a native R package.
